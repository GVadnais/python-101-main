# Improve the variable assignment shown below.
# Why should you change it?

color, year = "red", 1900

color = "red"
year = 1900


# Why should you change it? : Assigning several variables on one line is not recommended unless there's a clear link between the 2 variables conceptially speaking (min - max  or  start - end)
