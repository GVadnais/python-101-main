# Think about a task that you want to accomplish using programming
# Maybe you want to automate something you do every day on your computer?
# Break down some of the steps you can think of and write them in
# this file as pseudocode.
# You can come back and update this file when you've learned more.
# You can also add real Python code after learning the necessary concepts.
# For now, just practice breaking larger tasks into smaller steps
# and writing out your thoughts in pseudocode.



##Concept - Create an app that automates the creation of weekly grocery lists in relation to grocery's discounts and predetermined recipes
#create a recipe database containing the ingredients, the preparation time, the amount of portions, an healthy score and a score on the delicious scale
#Make an interface in witch I can put more details about my weekly needs (portions, time budget to cook this week, etc)
#create some kind of automation that grabs the mains discounts from specified groceries
#Make the app choose the optimal weekly menu based on discounts, time necessary to cook, good average on the delicious scale
#Make the grocery list for me
