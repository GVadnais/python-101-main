Explore the interpreter:

- Execute lines with syntax error and see what the response is.
  - What happens if you leave out a quotation or parenthesis?

    print("hello)          -->   SyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 1)
    print("hello world"    -->   SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Perhaps you forgot a comma?


  - How helpful are the error messages?

    Not extremely precise but indicates the line where the error occurs and it's nature.
 

- Use the `help()` function to explore what you can do with the interpreter.
  - For example execute `help('print')`.
        Help on built-in function print in module builtins:

        print(*args, sep=' ', end='\n', file=None, flush=False)
            Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default.

            sep
              string inserted between values, default a space.
            end
              string appended after the last value, default a newline.
            file
              a file-like object (stream); defaults to the current sys.stdout.
            flush
              whether to forcibly flush the stream.

  - Press `q` to exit.
    exit()    ---> q didn't work
